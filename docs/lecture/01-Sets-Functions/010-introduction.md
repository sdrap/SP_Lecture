# Introduction

This Chapter is dedicated to the fundamentals behind measure theory.
It covers and recall basic notions such as set theory, the algebraic properties of which.
It defines the notion of measurable and topological spaces.
It finally describe the properties of functions&mdash;measurable and continuous&mdash;that are compatibles with this algebraic set structures.
