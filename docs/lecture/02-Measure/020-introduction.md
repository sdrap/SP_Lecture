# Introduction

This Chapter introduce the notion of measure.
From the definition on a $\sigma$-algebra it goes forward to measure defined on simpler class of sets such as "Lebesgue/Stieljes" measure.
How to extend those measures to larger class of sets such as ring.
It finishes with Carathéodory's extension theorem that allows to extend those meaningfull measures to the $\sigma$-algebra.
