# Stochastic Integral

In the previous chapter, we saw that 

\[
  \exp \left( \int \sigma dW - \frac{1}{2}\int \sigma^2 dt \right)
\]

is a strictly positive local martingale.
On the other hand, we know that for a probability measure $Q \sim P$, the process $Z = (E[dQ/dP|\mathcal{F}_{t}])$ defines a strictly positive martingale.
It turns out that these two aspects are related to each others through the concepts of stochastic exponential and the Girsanov Theorem.
