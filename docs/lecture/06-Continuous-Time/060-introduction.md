# Continuous Time Processes: Lebesgue-Stieljes Integral, Martingales 

In this Chapter we will extend the notion of stochastic processes to the continuous time setting, that is, processes where time takes positive real values.
Throughout, $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ denotes a probability space.
Unless otherwise specified, stochastic processes are always implicitly considered as indexed by time $0\leq t < \infty$.

!!! warning

    Unless otherwize specified, the letters $q$ and $r$ used for time means that they are rational.
