# Stochastics

These lecture notes, still a work in progress, are for a course taught at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), for graduate students.


## Course Objective

This lecture aims at the evolution over time of systems that are subject to uncertainty: stochastic processes.

Throughout this lecture we will address the following fundamental concepts:

* **Probability:** probability space, probability measure, expectation, measure change, conditional expectation, stochastic kernel, independence as well as fundamental inequalities and relations.
* **Discrete Martingales:** discrete stochastic processes, information, stopping times, martingales and related fundamental results (convergence, law of large numbers, etc.)
* **Markov Processes:** concept of memoryless stochastic processes, discrete time results, construction of the Brownian motion.
* **Ito-Integral and Calculus:** construction of the stochastic integral, Ito-formula, applications.
* **Stochastic Exponential:** measure change, Girsanov formula and applications
* **Stochastic Differential Equations:** existence and uniqueness, strong vs weak solutions, ...
* **SDE and PDE:** Relation between PDE and SDE, Kolmogorov equation, Feynman-Kak formula and applications.


## Concrete Approach

The theoretical lecture combines blackboard lectures with practical applications.
Lecture notes will be provided and updated during the course.
The evaluation of the lecture will consists of 

* **Homework:** Once every two weeks to be handed out within two weeks by groups of 5-6
* **Quizz:** 3-4 quizz, in class, 30 min about the past lectures.
* **Final Exam:** 120 min final exam at the end of the semester.



## Prerequisite

The lecture suppose that students knows about basic algebra, analysis.
A previous knowledge about measure theory might be of help but nor necessary.


## Literature

The lecture follows the present lecture notes.
However those are inspired by uncountably many textbooks on the topic from which we present a short selection:

* Rick Durret[@durret01]: Excellent introduction to discrete stochastic processes (markov processesw and martingales and Brownian motion). No stochastic integral and SDEs
* Steve Shreve[@shreve2004][@shreve2004a]: Both books with a focus on Finance. The first one is discrete the second continuous and both approchable.
* Olav Kallenberg[@kallenberg2002]: Complete from probability to stochastic processes. General stochastic processes.
* Philip Protter[@protter]: Complete about general stochastic processes (w/wo jumps). Complex.
* Delacherie and Meyer[@Dellacherie1978][@Dellacherie1982]: The bible however machine typed and French
