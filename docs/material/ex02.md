# Exercise: Risk Management


!!! exercise 

    A random variable \( L \) is called normally distributed with mean \( \mu \) in \(\mathbb{R} \) and variance \( \sigma > 0 \) if it has a probability density given by
    
    \[
      f_{\mu,\sigma}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
    \]
    
    and we use the notation \( L \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \). We denote by
    
    \[
    F_{\mu,\sigma}(m) = P[L \leq m] = \int_{-\infty}^{m} f_{\mu,\sigma}(y) \, dy, \quad x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{and} \quad q_{\mu,\sigma}(s) = F^{-1}_{\mu,\sigma}(s), \quad s \in (0,1)
    \]
    
    the CDF and quantile of the normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma \).
    We use the simplified notations for the standard normal:
    
    \[
    f = f_{0,1}, \quad F = F_{0,1}, \quad q = q_{0,1}.
    \]
    
    1. Show that if \( L \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \), it holds \( \mu + \sigma L \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \).
    2. Show that if \( L \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), it holds \( -L \sim \mathcal{N}(-\mu, \sigma^2) \).
    3. Show that
    
        \[
        f_{\mu,\sigma}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma} f\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right), \quad
        \sigma^2 f^\prime_{\mu,\sigma} (x) = (\mu-x)f_{\mu,\sigma}(x)
        \]
    
        \[
        F_{\mu,\sigma}(x) = F\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right), \quad
        q_{\mu,\sigma}(s) = \mu + \sigma q(s).
        \]
    

    Recall that 

    \[
      \begin{align*}
        V@R_{\alpha}(L) & = \inf \{m \colon P[L>m]\geq \alpha\} = q_L(1-\alpha)\\
        ES_{\alpha}(L) & = \frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^\alpha V@R_{\alpha}(s) ds = \frac{1}{\alpha}\int_{1-\alpha}^1 q_L(s)ds
      \end{align*}
    \]

    and that both functionals are positive homogoneous.


    Show that for $L\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$

    \[
        V@R_{\alpha}(L) = \mu + \sigma V@R_{\alpha}(\bar{L}) \quad \text{and} \quad ES_{\alpha}(L) = \mu + \sigma ES_{\alpha}(\bar{L})
    \]

    where $\bar{L} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ (in other terms, to compute the value at risk or expected shortfal of normal distribution, you just need the V@R and ES of the standard normal distribution).

    Deduce that for normally distributed random variable $L$ with **zero mean**, $V@R$ and $ES$ are related through

    \[
        ES_{\alpha}(L) = C V@R_{\alpha}(L)
    \]

    for some constant $C$ which you provide explicitely.


!!! exercise "Dual Representation"


    We already know that the expected shortfall has two possible representations:
    
    \[
      \begin{align*}
         ES_\alpha(L) & = \frac{1}{\alpha} \int_{1-\alpha}^{1} q_L(s) ds\\
                      & = \inf\left\{ m + \frac{1}{\alpha} E\left[ (L-m)^+ \right] \right\}\\
                      & = q_L(1-\alpha) + \frac{1}{\alpha} E\left[ \left( L - q_L(1-\alpha) \right)^+ \right]
      \end{align*}
    \]
    
    We derive an alternative formulation in terms of duality, namely:
    
    \[
    ES_{\alpha}(L) = \sup\left\{ E^Q[L] \colon 0 \leq \frac{dQ}{dP} \leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \right\}
    \]
    
    This general statement says that the expected shortfall accounts for computing the expected loss under any alternative probability model \( Q \) such that \( Q \) is not "too" far away from \( P \) in the sense that the density is bounded by \( 1/\alpha \).
    
    1. Show that for every \( x \) and every \( y \) with \( 0 \leq y \leq 1/\alpha \) it holds:
    
        \[
        \frac{1}{\alpha} x^+ \geq xy
        \]
    
        In other terms, \( x^+ / \alpha = \sup\{ xy \colon 0 \leq y \leq 1/\alpha \} \), which is called Fenchel-Moreau duality.
    
    2. Using the fact that \( E[dQ/dP] = 1 \), show that if \( 0 \leq dQ/dP \leq 1/\alpha \), then it holds:
    
        \[
        m + \frac{1}{\alpha} E\left[ (L-m)^+ \right] \geq E^Q[L]
        \]
    
        and deduce that:
    
        \[
        ES_{\alpha}(L) \geq \sup\left\{ E^Q[L] \colon 0 \leq \frac{dQ}{dP} \leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \right\}
        \]
    
    3. Assuming that \( F_L \) is continuous and strictly increasing, show that if we define the random variable:
    
        \[
        \frac{dQ^\ast}{dP} = \frac{1}{\alpha} 1_{\{L \geq q_L(1-\alpha)\}}
        \]
    
        then it defines a probability measure \( Q^\ast \) such that \( 0 \leq dQ^\ast/dP \leq 1/\alpha \) and for which it holds:
    
        \[
        ES_{\alpha}(L) = E^{Q^\ast}[L]
        \]
    
        and deduce the duality formula â€” for which you now have an explicit \( Q^\ast \) that depends on \( L \).
